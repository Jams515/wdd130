     </h1>Ryan Taylor</h1> 
     
    <p>Hello! My name is Ryan, I'm 21 years old and this is my first semester at BYUI. I am a Computer Science major.
    I grew up in a small town called Gervais in the middle of the Willamette valley back in Oregon.</p>
    <p>Some of my favorite hobbies are skiing, reading, watching movies and tv, and video games. I am prone
    to injury and I'm told that I make a mean fried chicken. Those two cross paths far too often.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the Church my whole life and served a mission in the California, San Bernardino mission.
    Growing up in Oregon I was never surrounded by a large member population, so this is all a bit weird for me,
    but I look forward to getting to know you!<p>
    <p> Thanks for visitng my webpage! Heres a picture of me and my dog.</p>
