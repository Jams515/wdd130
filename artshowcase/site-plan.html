        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>

            Are you interested in learning about young, talented artists? Learning about their visions and aspirations
            to enhance the world of art? I’m a computer science major that’s building a website that showcases those
            young and talented artists and their work, giving them a platform that allows others to see their work and
            potentially engage with those artists. It will give them a wider range of influence and opportunity that
            they might not get otherwise. I’m hoping to make the future of art more accessible than ever, elevating
            their platform into something that could help them launch their careers.

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The audience for this website is for anyone looking to find original art, from primarily up and coming or
            unknown artists. It is a place to find all kinds of art, and all kinds of styles. The other audience this
            site will cater too is the artists themselves. The goal is to make a site that showcases art in a
            noncompetitive kind of way. All of the other art platforms have become essentially battlegrounds to try and
            grab an audience, and our goal is to mitigate that and make a safe easy space to showcase your art, one
            without the constant need to pump out as much art as you physically can.

            I chose the heading font because i found it for my wwr website and i really like it, its slick, clean, but
            not too stuffy. It looks nice but its not all up in your face kinda nice. I really like it is what i'm
            trying to say and i think that it fits the theme of this site perfectly.
