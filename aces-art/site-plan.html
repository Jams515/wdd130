        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>

            Are you interested in learning about young, talented artists? Learning about their visions and aspirations
            to enhance the world of art? I’m a computer science major that’s building a website that showcases those
            young and talented artists and their work, giving them a platform that allows others to see their work and
            potentially engage with those artists. It will give them a wider range of influence and opportunity that
            they might not get otherwise. I’m hoping to make the future of art more accessible than ever, elevating
            their platform into something that could help them launch their careers.

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The audience for this website is for anyone looking to find original art, from primarily up and coming or
            unknown artists. It is a place to find all kinds of art, and all kinds of styles. The other audience this
            site will cater too is the artists themselves. The goal is to make a site that showcases art in a
            noncompetitive kind of way. All of the other art platforms have become essentially battlegrounds to try and
            grab an audience, and our goal is to mitigate that and make a safe easy space to showcase your art, one
            without the constant need to pump out as much art as you physically can.

            I chose the heading font because i found it for my wwr website and i really like it, its slick, clean, but
            not too stuffy. It looks nice but its not all up in your face kinda nice. I really like it is what i'm
            trying to say and i think that it fits the theme of this site perfectly.

        <h3>Home page</h3>
        <p>
            Audience-
            Our audience is anyone looking to learn more about the featured artist or their art. This website will be
            for a single artist and their art, to give them a place that they can direct others too so that they can
            learn more about them.<br>

            Purpose-
            The purpose of this website is a multifaceted affair. I am making it to learn to make websites and pass a
            class. I am also making this website for my sister-in-law so that she has somewhere where she can show off
            her art and let people know more about her. It will be a place where she can launch whatever platform she
            wants, that can link back to her social media and maybe even include a business email. For now, it will just
            be a place that will showcase her and her art, but eventually if she wanted it could even turn into an
            online store that she could use to sell art or accept commissions.<br>

            Future of the Site-
            If all goes well this site could become a place for any beginning artist to get a platform. For right now
            it’s just for my sister in law, but if this idea works out I could make a version that expands to include
            more artists and that will reach a broader audience.

        <h3>About the Artist</h3>
        <p>
            Biography-
            Anais (Ace) has been drawing since she was 10 years old. Her style is heavily influenced by her beginning of
            drawing Anime and video game characters. Because of this, she mainly draws and paints humans. It slowly
            developed into being more realistic but still holds the simplicity of cartoon characters. Main subject of
            her art is Humans, the human figure is her muse. “I can draw anything if I stare at it long enough.” She is
            trying for a bright, smooth, elegant style. Her favorite art medium is watercolor, which she has been
            practicing for almost 2 years now. Kind of fitting because she’s obsessed with water; the element, what it
            represents/symbolism, its aesthetic and being in it. Swimming is her go to outdoor activity. She tried
            Prisma colored pencils, copic markers and acrylic paint before discovering watercolor is her favorite
            medium. It is smooth, fun to work with, and exciting. Water can be unpredictable. She loves the technique
            involved when using watercolor, how it can be light, soft and smooth, but also deep and chaotic. Born and
            raised in Houston, Texas. Moved to Idaho to attend University at BYU-I. Studied Animal Science for a year
            before switching to an Art major in 2021. She held off studying art because of the economic instability that
            comes from pursuing a career in Art. She knows she wants to be in a career she can be creative in, so for
            now, some kind of art degree will do. Her Instagram is @AceRianne. She follows many artists on Instagram,
            her favorites being Kelogsloops and Heikala. She has done a master copy of one of Heikala’s pieces.

            The rest of this content will be filled with descriptions and brief stories about that art that will be
            showcased on this website, since I do not currently have a list of that art, I am unable to provide these
            short descriptions as of right now, but in the future, they will be a part of the site. These images and
            their descriptions will help fill out the website as well as provide context for it. In the next couple
            weeks I will be able to add more images and text and really be able to flush out the content of this page,
            but for right now this is all I am able to get.
