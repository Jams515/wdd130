                <h4>Purpose-</h4>
                <p> The purpose of this website is a multifaceted affair. I am making it to learn to make websites and
                    pass a
                    class. I am also making this website for my sister-in-law so that she has somewhere where she can
                    show off
                    her art and let people know more about her. It will be a place where she can launch whatever
                    platform she
                    wants, that can link back to her social media and maybe even include a business email. For now, it
                    will just
                    be a place that will showcase her and her art, but eventually if she wanted it could even turn into
                    an
                    online store that she could use to sell art or accept commissions.</p>

                <h4>Future of the Site-</h4>
                <p>If all goes well this site could become a place for any beginning artist to get a platform. For right
                    now
                    itâ€™s just for my sister in law, but if this idea works out I could make a version that expands to
                    include
                    more artists and that will reach a broader audience.</p>
